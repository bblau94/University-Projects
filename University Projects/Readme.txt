The following assignments were completed during my undergraduate studies at Boston University. Every project was completed by me or in a group with one to two additional students, depending on the rules for each assignment. All projects required varying amounts of coding from the students. Base code was provided to different degrees for different projects. Some projects were completed without any provided code. Some projects had help from outside sources. These sources are listed in the comments of projects that used them.
Grades for the assignments vary. Any grades still available are listed. I listed approximate grades for projects from the CS320 course. Any approximate grades are listed with honest intentions and do represent the actual grades received to the best of my memory. Some grades are not listed because they are no longer available and I do not have enough recollection as to what they may have been. To avoid unintentional misinformation, I did not attempt to guess these grades.
