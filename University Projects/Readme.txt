The following assignments were completed during my undergraduate studies at Boston University. Every project was completed by me or in a group with one to two additional students, depending on the rules for each assignment. All projects required varying amounts of coding from the students. Base code was provided to different degrees for different projects. Some projects were completed without any provided code. Some projects had help from outside sources. These sources are listed in the comments of projects that used them.
