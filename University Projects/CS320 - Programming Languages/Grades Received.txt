The grades I received for these assignments became unavailable after the semester ended. They were no longer listed when I posted these files. However, all assignments in the CS320 class received a raw grade between (approximately) an 85 and a 100.
The midterm grade was received close to full credit, if not full credit. I also received full credit for the extra credit portion of the midterm.
I ended this course with a raw score of approximately 97.5 with the weighted grade being an A.
